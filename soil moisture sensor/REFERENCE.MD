### Soil Moisture Sensor
This project uses the following main components:
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- Redboard Qwiic
- Serial Enabled LCD

It displays a simple message based on the moisture from the sensor to let the carer know whether or not the planet requires water.

This is a simple project to understand the basics of the Soil Moisture Sensor and the LCD screen.

A much simpler project can be done with an LED light that adjusts based on the moisture as well, where red notifies the user that water is needed while green notifies that it has plenty.
